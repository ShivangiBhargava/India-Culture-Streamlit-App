# India-Culture-Streamlit-App

# Traditional Art & Cultural Tourism Explorer

# Solution Overview

I'll design a Streamlit application that showcases India's diverse traditional art forms, uncovers cultural experiences across the country, and promotes responsible tourism practices. The app will leverage data from government sources and present insights in an interactive, visually appealing way.

# Key Features

1. **Art Forms Gallery**: Interactive exploration of traditional Indian art forms
2. **Cultural Hotspots Map**: Geographic visualization of cultural destinations
3. **Tourism Trends**: Analysis of visitor patterns and seasonality
4. **Responsible Tourism Guide**: Best practices for sustainable cultural tourism
5. **Hidden Gems**: Showcasing lesser-known cultural destinations

## Implementation Plan

### Data Sources
- [Data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in) for art, culture, and tourism statistics
- Government reports on cultural heritage preservation
- UNESCO World Heritage Sites data
- Tourism department datasets
 

## Snowflake Data Model

The application would rely on the following Snowflake tables:

1. `ART_FORMS` - Details of traditional art forms
   - art_form (string)
   - state (string)
   - category (string - painting, sculpture, textile, etc.)
   - origin (string)
   - materials (string)
   - description (string)
   - significance (string)
   - image_path (string)
   - video_url (string)

2. `CULTURAL_DESTINATIONS` - Cultural sites across India
   - name (string)
   - state (string)
   - category (string - temple, fort, museum, etc.)
   - latitude (float)
   - longitude (float)
   - annual_visitors (int)
   - significance (string)
   - unique_aspect (string)
   - best_season (string)
   - image_path (string)

3. `TOURISM_TRENDS` - Visitor statistics
   - site_name (string)
   - month (string)
   - visitor_count (int)
   - year (int)

4. `GOVERNMENT_INITIATIVES` - Preservation programs
   - initiative_name (string)
   - ministry (string)
   - year_launched (int)
   - budget (float)
   - impact_description (string)

5. `ARTISAN_PROGRAMS` - Artisan support initiatives
   - program_name (string)
   - organization (string)
   - art_forms_supported (string)
   - participation_details (string)
   - website_url (string)

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Data Pipeline**: Regular updates from government sources to Snowflake
2. **Image Storage**: Cloud storage for art form and destination images
3. **Authentication**: Optional login for personalized recommendations
4. **Performance**: Caching strategies for large datasets
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring good experience on all devices

This solution provides a comprehensive platform to explore India's cultural heritage while promoting responsible tourism practices through data-driven insights.
